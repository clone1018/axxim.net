                    I'm a Senior Software Engineer &amp; manager of engineering teams &amp; organizations with over 11 years of hands on development and high level strategic vision. My unique accelerated experience has given me insight into every role of an engineering organization which prepares me to lead with a strong vision, but the tact technical teams need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate technologist that believes in a very product-oriented approach to ensure business needs are accomplished. My approach to software engineering is found in the word engineer, as I believe it is our jobs to strive for quality products that are more than the specifications. I believe very strongly in being open, clear, and transparent with everyone who I interact with.

                    <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Classic.com is an data platform focused on empowering classic car buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts with insights to inform their next purchase or sale. Filled with vehicle prices, conditions, attributes, and history from over 100 different auction houses & dealers, Classic.com has amassed over a decade of data for 400,000+ classic & collectable vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the first Elixir engineer at Classic.com, my primary responsibility was converting the legacy Next.js powered site into a fast, reliable, scalable platform powered by Elixir & Phoenix Live View. Due to this conversion, the site performance and indexability increased dramatically doubling the growth of Classic.com since we completed the project. In addition to development, I was also responsible for training many of the team on the Elixir programming language and Phoenix Live View paradigms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my other major feats include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reducing overall site downtime & production issues while improving page load speed.</li>
                        <li>Simplified deployment strategy by introducing CI/CD for staging & production pipelines.</li>
                        <li>Implemented a complex multi-layer filtering system for searches.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Glimesh is a next-gen live streaming platform for content creators to share their experiences with the world. The platform focuses on providing lightning-fast live streams with a systematic approach to fairness for creators. I founded Glimesh in 2020 after the famous platform Mixer was shut down and have been working on it since.

                        As the founder of Glimesh I am responsible for everything we do, but ultimately that means I spend a lot of my time architecting and developing our core software. My major technical accomplishment so far has building a completely real time public API based around Elixir's pubsub systems. Currently do we about 10 million API requests per month.
